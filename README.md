## file_data

File Data holds information about the mp3, eaf, folder and file. This will only work if the whole corpus tree is cloned from GitHub or the corpus structure is reassembled by hand.

    self.file_data  'mp3_paths' :      path to the original mp3 
                    'eaf_path' :        path to the eaf

## _eaf_dataÂ¶

The eaf data is not supposed to be accessed, this just holds information to (re-)build an eaf

    self._eaf_data  'time_dictionary' :      the time dictionary data from the original eaf
                      'eaf_duration' :          the last entry in the time dictionary
                      'date' :                  the date from the eaf name
                      'property_tag' :          the property tag contents from the eaf




# Detailed Overview

## speech_data details

**samples**

The number of samples that have been extracted from the \_1_\und mp3 using [librosa](https://librosa.org/doc/latest/index.html)
***
 **sample_rate**
 
The sample rate that has been extracted from the \_1_\und mp3 using [librosa](https://librosa.org/doc/latest/index.html)


 **length**
 
The length, calculated from sample_rate * samples


 **orig_lang**
 
(unset)


 **orig_lang_kaldi**
 
The original language detected by Kaldi. This is documented in a function within container_utils.
The function weights each language detected by Kaldi according to its segment duration(s).


 **kaldi_data**
 
The most highly weighted languages for comparison purposes.


 **orig_lang_zcr**
 
The original language detected by the zcr method. This is documented in a function within container_utils.
This calculates the zero-crossing-rate in windows for each audio channel.
Interpreters often speak "on top" of a muffled original speaker channel, therefore the audio signal has a systematically different structure than the audio signal that contains only one person speaking. Their microphones may also be different and they are often too close to the microphone. Last but not least the underlying noise level is a lot lower in the cabin.
This is not always reliable because sometimes there is no interpreter and sometimes the interpreter is tech-savvy enough to completely remove the original speaker channel.


 **zcr_data**
 
The zcr data for comparison purposes.


 **orig_lang_whisper**



                        'zcr_data' :      set_orig_lang_zcr() (requires pickle from zcr)

                        'cycle' :     set_session_data() requires session_list
                        'subject' : set_subject() requires subject-with-recording.pickle --- could be replaced eventually with insanely precise souping.
                        'chair' :   set_chair_from_time() requires chair-changes.pickle --- should be replaced eventually from insanely precise souping.
                        'orig_w_verbatim_langs' : manually set from the cleaned resoup
                        'orig_lang_ed': based on europarl direct.
                        'orig_lang_eu' : based on europarl
